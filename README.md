Hi there,
to run the scripts please follow the below steps:-

1. Please make a new folder named - "Spotify-Clone"
2. Make a new folder names "songs", now put all 9 mp3 files in it.
3. Now keep all the files in the repository into the parent folder- "Spotify-Clone"
4. Now open VSCode, click on file-->Open Folder-->Spotify-Clone
5. Use live server to run the script (download the live server extension if you haven't already)

Thanks:)
